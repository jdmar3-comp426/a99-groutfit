The API we've used for the backend is powered by an Express application framework. 
We're also importing a modules including browser-sync to render the webpage for testing purposes in the early stages of development, better-sqlite3 for the database and md5 for password encyption. 
Our server js file is also holding the code for various endpoints responsible for updating the database when the user creates a new account or changes the details of their account such as the username or the password. Certain endpoints are hidden to the user because they are used to handle the logic of updating the database and end up redirecting the user to the appropriate page that should be rendered. We're using various HTTP methods for the endpoints such as get, post, patch and delete. The user is not exposed to certain endpoints such as /app/users, which shows the entire content of our endpoints such as the object of every user and their contents all in JSON format.
